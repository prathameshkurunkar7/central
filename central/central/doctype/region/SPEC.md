# Regional configuration

## Purpose

Region is Central's one record for a region: its customer-facing identity (code, display
name, geography), and its connection to the Atlas that runs it (endpoint, numeric ID,
signed-access health). The numeric ID comes from Atlas Settings and defines the token
audience for every regional service — Atlas, Cargo, and the Proxy all mint against it.

## Configuration

Set `base_url` to the direct Atlas address and `atlas_region_id` to the verified value from
0 through 65535. The identifier uses a Data field so blank and valid region zero remain
distinct. Validation normalizes it to decimal form, and the controller adds a unique
database constraint.

Set `proxy_domain` to the wildcard zone the regional proxy serves, without the leading `*.`,
such as `par-2.fc.frappe.dev`. Central builds a server's bench gateway from it as
`https://admin-vm-<label>.<proxy_domain>`. The label is the VM's mesh address encoded the
way the regional automatic proxy decodes it: the six hextets after the mesh prefix as one
base-36 number, VM identity above tenant. The tenant API does not publish the zone, so the
value is operator-entered and verified like the numeric region ID. A blank zone leaves
servers without a gateway, and one-click Open stays unavailable.

The regional client requires HTTPS. HTTP is allowed only for localhost addresses when
Central developer mode is enabled. Embedded credentials, queries, and fragments are
refused. Requests do not follow redirects or retry automatically.

Initialize Central's [Atlas signing key](../central_sso_settings/SPEC.md) and configure its
public endpoint in Atlas before testing the connection. Regional reads use the signed
tenant API at `/api/atlas`. They do not use the admin API key or Central tunnel address.

## Operation

**Test Connection** is an operator action. It calls the image list with a Central token and
the system tenant header. It requires a valid image-list response. A generic Framework
ping does not prove regional authentication. It only reads from Atlas: it records
`reachable`, `connection_checked_at`, and `connection_error`, and never changes Atlas's own
configuration. A timeout, rejected credential, invalid response, or missing regional
configuration leaves a readable failure on the record. The saved configuration is locked
during the check so another edit cannot receive a stale result.

**Enroll Atlas** is a separate operator action, shown only on the Atlas tab. It points
Atlas's virtual-machine-state deliveries at Central's receiver (`PUT /api/atlas/webhooks`),
minting `webhook_secret` the first time it runs and reusing it after. The payload's
`central_id` comes from `Central Settings.central_id` (default 1) and is only worth
raising where more than one Central environment shares an Atlas — Atlas itself refuses
anything but 1 outside developer mode. Run it after Test Connection succeeds; it does not
itself prove Atlas is reachable. A failure raises and shows in the Desk like any other
action; nothing about it is recorded on the record itself.

Changing the endpoint or numeric region ID clears the connection result. Image offerings
read the regional catalog on demand.

The integration client also has a Team read path. It checks `server:view` through Central
IAM and reads the tenant ID from the authorized Team. The operator path is the only path
that selects system tenant zero.

`central.api.servers.list_instances` — the console's region picker — reads only the
non-secret allowlist (`region`, `status`, `reachable`, and the display fields). `base_url`,
`atlas_region_id`, and `webhook_secret` never leave a System Manager session.

## Scope and Cargo

Cargo also connects through this record, in its own `cargo_*` fields, under the Cargo tab.
Cargo runs on infrastructure Atlas itself provisions in the region (see
`atlas/docs/bootstrapping.md`) and holds its own credentials to call Atlas and the Proxy —
neither of those is Central's concern. What Central needs is narrower: `cargo_base_url`
(operator-entered, the same way Atlas's `base_url` is) and `cargo_status`, plus
`cargo_webhook_secret`, which verifies its service reports (`central.integrations.
state_delivery.accept_cargo_report`).

**Enroll Cargo** is the operator action that finishes the connection, once the address is
in, shown only on the Cargo tab. It checks the Frappe liveness endpoint
(`/api/method/ping`) of `cargo_base_url` first —
Cargo has no polled Test Connection of its own, so this is the one place Central checks
before it acts — then mints a fresh `cargo_webhook_secret` and hands it to Cargo through
`cargo.api.webhooks.configure` (signed with `mint_cargo_token`), and only then sets
`cargo_status` to `Registered`. Cargo reports itself in from there, once it and its first
storage cluster exist; `accept_cargo_report` refuses every report until this has run. A
failure — Cargo not up yet, or rejecting the configuration — raises and shows in the Desk;
run the action again once Cargo answers.

Atlas and Cargo are not peers: Cargo is created by Atlas and depends on it being there
first. That asymmetry is a fact about provisioning, not about where Central keeps its own
bookkeeping — both connections live on Region, each behind its own mixin
(`AtlasConnectionMixin` in `atlas_connection.py`, `CargoConnectionMixin` in
`cargo_connection.py`), so the two stay easy to tell apart in the code and never share a
field.

## Migration

Region absorbed the connection fields that used to live on the separate `Atlas Instance`
doctype. `Virtual Machine.cluster`, `Resource Action.atlas_instance`, and the billing
`cluster` Link fields all point at Region directly now; there is no second doctype to join
through. `Cargo Instance` folded in the same way, into the `cargo_*` fields.

## Scope and validation

The signed client in `central.integrations.atlas` owns regional image reads, VM creation,
VM reads, and power operations. [Resource Action](../resource_action/SPEC.md) owns their
durable request and recovery state.

Run `central.tests.test_regional_configuration` for request headers, tenant boundaries,
malformed responses, failure recording, and configuration invalidation. Real regional
acceptance remains pending until staging is ready.
