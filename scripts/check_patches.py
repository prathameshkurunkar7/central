"""CI guard: every patch module under central/patches/v0_0/ must be listed in
central/patches.txt, so a patch is never written and silently never run.

Five billing-owned modules pre-date this guard and are knowingly unlisted
(tracked in the refactor plan, out of scope to wire up). They are allow-listed
below; anything *new* that is unlisted fails CI. Removing an allow-listed entry
once it is wired into patches.txt is the intended end state — do not add to this
list to silence a new orphan.

Run: python scripts/check_patches.py  (from the app root)
